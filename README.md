## Architecture üèõ

**Model - View - ViewModel (MVVM)** is the industry recognized software architecture pattern that overcomes all drawbacks of MVP and MVC design patterns. MVVM suggests separating the data presentation logic(Views or UI) from the core business logic part of the application

## Libraries üõ† ‚öôÔ∏è
- [Kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin) -> The Kotlin Programming Language.
- [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) -> A type-safe HTTP client for Android and the JVM.
- [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp) -> Square‚Äôs meticulous HTTP client for the JVM, Android, and GraalVM.
- [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) -> Library support for Kotlin coroutines
- [Dagger Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) -> Hilt provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.
- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) -> ViewModel class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
- [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) -> An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
- [Junit](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/local-tests?hl=tr) -> A local test runs directly on your own workstation, rather than an Android device or emulator. As such, it uses your local Java Virtual Machine (JVM), rather than an Android device to run tests. Local tests enable you to evaluate your app's logic more quickly.
